Backup GitBucket - Backup all your GitHub and BitBucket repositories

- gets a list of all the repos you have access to
- creates a local mirror

Better have a local copy in case the internet burn up ;-)

How to use?

Edit config.yaml.sample to match your settings.
Call `backup-gitbucket <config.yaml>`

Enjoy,
